"""Process initialization overlay for TecoVLLM on SDAA accelerator.

Binds the in-repo BlockAttention compatibility layer before engine
initialization so that ``vllm_sdaa``'s unimplemented attention stub is
replaced without ever writing to vendor site-packages and without leaving a
per-forward branch in the hot path.

It also binds the Qwen3 language tower's ``RMSNorm`` to the official
``tecoops.rms_norm`` operator.  Audit fact that motivated it: before this
overlay the official operator had **0 calls** in a real forward (see
``experiments/internvl3_5-8b.md`` §12.2).  The binding replaces the module-level
``RMSNorm`` name in ``vllm.model_executor.models.qwen3`` **and**
``...models.qwen2`` (the final norm is constructed by ``Qwen2Model``, which
``Qwen3Model`` inherits).  It is installed unconditionally and fails closed: if
the vendor layout moved, the process exits non-zero instead of silently
running without the official operator.

Scope note (InternVL3_5-8B): the MiniCPM5-1B branch's *Llama-specific* binding
is not ported verbatim; this one targets Qwen3 and is validated by an
init-time identity check plus a call-count receipt.

Loaded automatically by CPython via ``sitecustomize`` when this directory is
placed on ``PYTHONPATH`` (see scripts/serve_internvl.sh).
